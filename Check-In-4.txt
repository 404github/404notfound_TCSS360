US05: As a DIYer, I want to be able to sort by the projectâ€™s costs, duration, and other data that have ranking order.

Codes to look at:
DIYapplication/src/model/ProjectComparator.java
https://github.com/404github/404notfound_TCSS360/blob/master/DIYapplication/src/model/ProjectComparator.java

JUnit test case:
DIYapplication/src/test/SortingTest.java
